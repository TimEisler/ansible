bugfixes:
  - ansible-test - Virtual environments managed by ansible-test now use consistent versions of ``pip``, ``setuptools`` and ``wheel``.
                   This avoids issues with virtual environments containing outdated or dysfunctional versions of these tools.
                   The initial bootstrapping of ``pip`` is done by ansible-test from an HTTPS endpoint instead of creating the virtual environment with it already present.
  - ansible-test - Sanity tests run with the ``--requirements` option for Python 2.x now install ``virtualenv`` when it is missing or too old.
                   Previously it was only installed if missing.
                   Version 16.7.12 is now installed instead of the latest version.
  - ansible-test - All virtual environments managed by ansible-test are marked as usable after being bootstrapped, to avoid errors caused by use of incomplete environments.
                   Previously this was only done for sanity tests.
                   Existing environments from previous versions of ansible-test will be recreated on demand due to lacking the new marker.
minor_changes:
  - ansible-test - The ``pip`` and ``wheel`` packages are removed from all sanity test virtual environments after installation completes to reduce their size.
                   Previously they were only removed from the environments used for the ``import`` sanity test.
  - ansible-test - The hash for all managed sanity test virtual environments has changed.
                   Containers that include ``ansible-test sanity --prime-venvs`` will need to be rebuilt to continue using primed virtual environments.
