bugfixes:
  - shell/command - only skip in check mode if the options `creates` and `removes` are both None.
  - shell/command - only return changed as True if the task has not been skipped.
  - script - skip in check mode if the plugin cannot determine if a change will occur (i.e. neither `creates` or `removes` are provided).
